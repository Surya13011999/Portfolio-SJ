            <div class="des">
                <p>Bus tracking is an application that tracks a bus and gathers the distance to each station along its route. 
                        This tracking System avoids the installation of an electronic device in a vehicle, and is replaced with an installed Android App on any Smartphone to enable the Administrator/User to track the vehicle's location. 
                        The tracking is enabled using the GPS in the android device that is on the bus.
                        The users can get flexibility of planning travel using the app, to decide on which bus to take or when to catch the bus. The waiting time of the user can be reduced.
                        The different queries and efficient route management can be easily done through central server system.

                <p>Tourism has turned out to be an economic booster contributing to the economic development of many countries over the last few decades. People see holidays as a necessity, and not as luxury in the present scenario. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Many foreigners and also native users are experience this beautiful place. But every time not everyone get to experience everything in Kerala or any other place. This is mainly due to the amount of less knowledge about that places and activities about them. That is why we are going to develop a portal is to make the travel easy and comfortable for the userâ€™s right from finding the location based on Google geo location. This project is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript as front end design tool, JSP as server side Scripting and MySQL as the Backend</p>
